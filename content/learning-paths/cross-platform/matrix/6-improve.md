In this chapter, we will analyze the performance of our Matrix library and spot
places where it could be improved.

Performance optimization is a very vast topic that would deserve several
learning paths, so we will only stay at a high level in this learning path
and point to other more specific learning paths and tools.

## Vectorization

## Threading

## What have we achieved so far ?

In this chapter, we have been able to analyze and improve the performance
of our code base, while ensuring we have not regressed functionally.
