Over time, the Arm architecture evolves to provide the ecosystem with ever more
powerful instructions dedicated to solving efficiently specific problems.
In this chapter, taking SME2 as an example, we will show how to add support
for those new instructions in our matrix library (and ensure the library is
still correct) although those instructions are not widely available ---
at the time of writing this learning path.

The benefit for our library users is that at the time the hardware will
support those new instructions, the library will be ready to take advantage
of those new instructions.
